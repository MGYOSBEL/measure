# Measures

Simple Python 3 application that consumes a REST API and sends the fetched data through a RabbitMQ queue.
## How to run the app:
1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure to have the virtual environment activated(some IDEs may do that automatically)
   - `python -m virtualenv venv`
   - `source venv/bin/activate`
3. Install the dependencies: 
   - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the main app: 
   - `python app.py`
